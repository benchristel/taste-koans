# taste koans

This is a set of tiny examples/exercises to get you started
writing unit tests with [taste](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@benchristel/taste).

## Setup

Assuming you have `git`, `node`, and `yarn`:

- clone this repo and `cd` into it
- `yarn install`
- `yarn run snowpack dev`

A browser tab will open, in which you'll see a bunch of test failures.

Your challenge is to fix the failures one by one. The tests
live in `koans.js`. Replace the `_` placeholders with the
right values to make the tests pass.
